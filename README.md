<a name="Description"></a>
## Description

We were motivated to create this full-stack application with the intent to make an e-commerce website, much like the way MEC or SAIL works.
We made this project as a team to create a full stack application, more as a demonstration of how much we learned over the course of the program.
It is the one stop shop for all things outdoors. A niche market for the outdoorsy people with great taste and knows what they want should be top quality products.
We learned how to intergrate MERN stacking and how to add stripe functionality inside a single page application.

<a name="Future"></a>
## Future

There are a few things that we would like to add in such as the stripe payment feature and for the category menu dropdown menu to grab and filter items properly.

<a name="Installation"></a>
## Installation

You can install by cloning the repo, go into the terminal and run npm i. run npm seed to seed the data and finally to start the app npm run develop.

<a name="Usage"></a>
## Usage

After you run develop, you can see the fully functional website, sign up by clicking the signup icon on the navbar and then input your information. You can then add products into your cart. You can checkout by going into your cart at the navbar and see what items are in your cart along with the total. After that you can type in your payment information to buy said product.
